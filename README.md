# My Personal Portfolio Website

I'm Duncan Grimes, a senior at Vanderbilt University graduating in Spring 2025. I will be graduating with majors in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, as well as a minor in Business.

Please enjoy reading about some projects I've worked on and try a demo of the Rostr platform I built in Summer 2024.
